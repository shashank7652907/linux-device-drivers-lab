# linux-device-drivers-lab

This repository is a hands-on learning workspace for **Linux kernel device driver development**.

The focus is on understanding how device drivers work internally by building them from scratch, experimenting, and learning through iteration — not by copying ready-made code.

This repository will be updated continuously as new drivers and kernel concepts are explored.
